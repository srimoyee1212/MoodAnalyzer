# MoodAnalyzer: Accessible AI-Powered Emotional Insights for All

## üìù Description

MoodAnalyzer is an innovative AI-powered iOS (mobile) application that helps users gain insights into their emotional well-being through a combination of **adaptive questionnaires and expressive drawing analysis**. Users complete a structured emotional assessment and then express themselves through guided drawings. Our AI analyzes their responses and artwork using **psychological theories, color psychology, and composition analysis**, generating a **personalized emotional report**. The app provides a **comprehensive PDF summary**, allowing users to track their emotional journey over time and share insights with mental health professionals.

**Important:** This tool is not a medical prescription but rather a **diagnostic aid** that specialists can use to support therapy and emotional assessments.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Key Functionalities

- Drawing analysis only - For younger children and greater degree of mental trauma, a simple drawing interface that provides simple AI based prompts (eg: draw something that makes you feel at home) and analyzes what the user draws on their screen to provide analysis based on stroke, color choice, line smoothness, what the drawing depicts and symbolizes.

- Adult questionnaire and artwork analyis - the AI intelligently prompts users with relevant questions based on their responses to a few anchor questions to delve deeper into their mental state.

- Green questionnaire - Similar to adult questionnaire and artwork analysis but tailored to make the questions relevant to school kids. This category is specifically enabled as more and more school kids have unresolved mental trauma.
